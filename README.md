Shades of Success -  A UX ODYSSEY INTO INDIAN SUNGLASSES

Source files for my UX design project, a sunglasses e-commerce platform tailored for the Indian market, showcased on Behance.

# Overview
"Shades of Success" is a UX design project aimed at creating an intuitive, culturally resonant e-commerce platform for sunglasses in India. Through extensive user research, including interviews and surveys, the project identified key pain points in online eyewear shopping, such as fit concerns and style preferences. The design process involved crafting low-fidelity wireframes, interactive prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups to deliver a seamless, visually appealing experience. Key features include a virtual try-on tool, personalized style recommendations, and a streamlined checkout flow, all optimized for mobile users in Indiaâ€™s diverse market.
